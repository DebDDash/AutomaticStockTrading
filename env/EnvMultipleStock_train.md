# State Representation
-The state representation includes various components such as account balance, stock prices, stock holdings, and several technical indicators (MACD, RSI, CCI, ADX).
- The state is a list with a fixed structure, combining account-related information, stock prices, stock holdings, and technical indicators.

# Action Space:
- The action space is a continuous space represented by a Box in Gym.
- Each action corresponds to a decision to buy or sell a certain amount of each stock. The action values are normalized between -1 and 1.

# Buy and Sell Logic:
- _sell_stock and _buy_stock methods handle buying and selling logic.
- Transactions are subject to transaction fees (TRANSACTION_FEE_PERCENT).
- The environment keeps track of costs, trades, and updates the account balance and stock holdings accordingly.

# Step Function:
- The step function is the core of the environment, simulating one step in the stock trading process.
- It applies buy and sell actions, updates the state based on the new day's data, and calculates rewards.

# Reward Calculation:
- The reward is computed based on the change in the total asset value. Positive rewards indicate profitable decisions, while negative rewards represent losses.
- The REWARD_SCALING constant is used to scale the reward.

# Rendering and Saving:
- The render function returns the current state. Rendering may not be actively used in training RL agents but could be helpful for analysis.
- The environment has some code for saving results, such as plotting the account value and saving it to a CSV file.

# Termination:
- The environment terminates when the last day of the dataset is reached.
- After termination, it may save and plot results, such as the account value and daily returns.

# Reset Function:
- The reset function resets the environment to its initial state, allowing for multiple episodes during training.

# Seed Function:
- The _seed function seeds the random number generator to ensure reproducibility.

# Normalization and Constants:
- HMAX_NORMALIZE is used to normalize action values.
- Constants like INITIAL_ACCOUNT_BALANCE, STOCK_DIM, TRANSACTION_FEE_PERCENT, and REWARD_SCALING are set to define the environment's parameters.
